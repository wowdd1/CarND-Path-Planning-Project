how to generating path

1. if the car just star, then generating a init path to XY points

2. if previous XY points size less than PATH_SIZE_CUTOFF(10), then:

  2.1. use BehaviorPlanner generating a behavior

      keypoint: the sensor fusion data is be used here, the car konw other cars's position and speed,
                so it can computing which behavior(Turn Left, Turn Right, Keep Lane) is best for current position,
                then return the lowest cost behavior

  2.2. use Trajectory generating trajectory in the s-d frame for next TRAVERSE_TIME(2.0)

      keypoint: use s-d frame for simple computing trajectory, use the behavior for computing the target d,
                use car speed, current postion and TRAVERSE_TIME computing target s,
                use JMT for computing lowest Jerk trajectory

  2.3. use pathConverter convert this trajectory in the s-d frame to XY points

      keypoint: highway map data([x,y,s,dx,dy]) and spline

  2.4. append the XY points to the previous XY points

3. send the XY points to simulator
